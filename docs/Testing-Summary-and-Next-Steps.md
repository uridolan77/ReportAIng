## 🧪 **Test Scenarios Validated**

### Scenario 1: Game Performance Analysis ✅
```
Input: "Show me NetEnt slot performance this month"
Expected: Game tables + gaming metrics + provider filtering
Result: ✅ PASSED - Correct table selection and context
```

### Scenario 2: Provider Comparison ✅
```
Input: "Compare Microgaming vs Pragmatic Play revenue"
Expected: Game tables + provider comparison logic
Result: ✅ PASSED - Appropriate gaming context applied
```

### Scenario 3: Financial Analysis (Control) ✅
```
Input: "Show me deposits by brand today"
Expected: Main table + financial rules (no game context)
Result: ✅ PASSED - Correctly avoided game tables
```

### Scenario 4: Mixed Query ✅
```
Input: "Top players by game revenue"
Expected: Game + player tables with appropriate joins
Result: ✅ PASSED - Multi-domain context handled correctly
```
