# 🧹 **Infrastructure Deep Cleanup Plan**

## **📋 Overview**

This document outlines the comprehensive deep cleanup plan for the Infrastructure layer to eliminate duplicates, consolidate similar services, and establish a clean, maintainable architecture following the successful API cleanup.

## **🔍 Issues Identified**

### **1. Repository Layer Duplication**
- **Problem**: `UserRepository` and `UserEntityRepository` doing similar work
- **Impact**: Confusion, maintenance overhead, potential inconsistencies
- **Solution**: Consolidate into single `UserRepository` with unified interface

### **2. Cache Service Fragmentation**
- **Problem**: Multiple cache implementations (`CacheService`, `MemoryOptimizedCacheService`, `DistributedCacheService`)
- **Impact**: Complex service registration, unclear which to use when
- **Solution**: Create unified `CacheService` with automatic fallback strategy

### **3. Schema Service Complexity**
- **Problem**: `SchemaService`, `ShardedSchemaService`, `CachedSchemaService` overlap
- **Impact**: Complex decorator pattern, hard to understand data flow
- **Solution**: Consolidate into single service with built-in caching and sharding

### **4. Streaming Service Overlap**
- **Problem**: Multiple streaming implementations with unclear boundaries
- **Impact**: Duplicate code, inconsistent behavior
- **Solution**: Unified streaming service with clear interfaces

### **5. Service Registration Complexity**
- **Problem**: Too many decorators and complex dependency chains in Program.cs
- **Impact**: Hard to debug, performance overhead, maintenance issues
- **Solution**: Simplify registration with clear service hierarchies

## **🎯 Cleanup Phases**
