# NetEnt Game Data Issue Analysis

## Problem Summary
The query "NetEnt games performance this month" executed successfully but returned 0 rows, indicating no data matched the criteria.

## Log Analysis
- **Execution Time**: 16,970ms (successful)
- **Row Count**: 0 (no data found)
- **Cache Key**: 86EB4E38294022C22BAF190E5880B84FD9DCC0107DB5E880A8B1A9D73BBB6604
- **Query Type**: Game-related query with provider filtering and date range

## Likely Root Causes

### 1. No Data for Current Month (June 2025)
- The query filters for current month: `dag.GameDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, GETDATE()), 0)`
- June 2025 might not have NetEnt game data yet
- **Solution**: Test with different time ranges

### 2. Provider Name Variations
- "NetEnt" might be stored differently in the database
- Possible variations: "Net Entertainment", "NETENT", "netent", "NetEnt AB"
- **Solution**: Check all provider names in Games table

### 3. GameID Join Logic Issue
- Join condition: `g.GameID = dag.GameID - 1000000`
- GameID ranges might not align between tables
- **Solution**: Verify GameID ranges in both tables

### 4. Data Availability Issues
- `tbl_Daily_actions_games` might lack recent data
- Games table might not contain NetEnt games
- **Solution**: Check data freshness and provider coverage

## Recommended Testing Approach

### Phase 1: Time Range Testing
1. "NetEnt games performance last month"
2. "NetEnt games performance last 30 days"
3. "NetEnt games performance last week"
4. "All NetEnt games" (no time filter)

### Phase 2: Provider Testing
1. "Game providers list"
2. "Top game providers by revenue"
3. "Microgaming games performance this month"
4. "Pragmatic Play games performance this month"

### Phase 3: General Data Testing
1. "Top games this month"
2. "Games performance yesterday"
3. "Total game sessions this week"
4. "Game data availability check"

### Phase 4: Database Investigation
1. Check Games table for NetEnt entries
2. Verify GameID ranges and join logic
3. Check latest dates in tbl_Daily_actions_games
4. Validate provider name variations

## Expected SQL Pattern
The AI should generate SQL similar to:
```sql
SELECT g.GameName, g.Provider, g.GameType,
       SUM(dag.RealBetAmount) AS TotalBets,
       SUM(dag.RealWinAmount) AS TotalWins,
       SUM(dag.NetGamingRevenue) AS NetRevenue,
       SUM(dag.NumberofSessions) AS TotalSessions
FROM [DailyActionsDB].[common].[tbl_Daily_actions_games] dag WITH (NOLOCK)
INNER JOIN dbo.Games g WITH (NOLOCK) ON g.GameID = dag.GameID - 1000000
WHERE dag.GameDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, GETDATE()), 0)
  AND dag.GameDate < DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, GETDATE()) + 1, 0)
  AND g.Provider = 'NetEnt'
GROUP BY g.GameName, g.Provider, g.GameType
ORDER BY NetRevenue DESC
```

## Quick Diagnostic Queries
Run these directly in the application:

1. **Check current month data**:
   - "How many game records exist this month?"

2. **Check NetEnt games**:
   - "List all NetEnt games in the system"

3. **Check providers**:
   - "Show all game providers"

4. **Check recent data**:
   - "Latest game data available"

## Next Steps
1. Test alternative time ranges and providers
2. If issue persists, investigate database schema and data availability
3. Consider adjusting date filtering logic if data is not current
4. Verify provider name standardization in the Games table

## Status
- ✅ Query execution successful
- ❌ No data returned
- 🔍 Investigation needed for data availability and filtering criteria
