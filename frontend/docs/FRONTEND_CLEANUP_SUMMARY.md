## Migration Guide

### For Developers Using These Components

**Old Imports:**
```typescript
import { EnhancedQueryBuilder } from './components/QueryInterface/EnhancedQueryBuilder';
import { AdvancedChart } from './components/Visualization/AdvancedChart';
import { EnhancedDashboardInterface } from './components/Enhanced/EnhancedDashboardInterface';
```

**New Imports:**
```typescript
import { QueryBuilder } from './components/QueryInterface/QueryBuilder';
import { Chart } from './components/Visualization/Chart';
import { DashboardManager } from './components/Dashboard/DashboardManager';
```

**Or use the unified index:**
```typescript
import { QueryBuilder, Chart, DashboardManager } from './components';
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-up Actions
1. **Update all import statements** throughout the application
2. **Test all consolidated components** to ensure functionality
3. **Update documentation** to reflect new component structure
4. **Consider similar cleanup** for other parts of the application
5. **Establish naming conventions** to prevent future duplication

### Future Maintenance
- Use the unified components as the single source of truth
- Avoid creating "Enhanced" or "Advanced" variants
- Follow the established folder structure
- Use the main index.ts for clean imports

## Conclusion

The frontend components cleanup successfully:
- ✅ Removed 15+ duplicate components
- ✅ Eliminated inconsistent naming (Enhanced, Advanced, etc.)
- ✅ Consolidated functionality into unified components
- ✅ Improved folder organization
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality
