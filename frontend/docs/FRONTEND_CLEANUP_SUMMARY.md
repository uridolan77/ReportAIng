**Or use the unified index:**
```typescript
import { QueryBuilder, Chart, DashboardManager } from './components';
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-up Actions
1. **Update all import statements** throughout the application
2. **Test all consolidated components** to ensure functionality
3. **Update documentation** to reflect new component structure
4. **Consider similar cleanup** for other parts of the application
5. **Establish naming conventions** to prevent future duplication

### Future Maintenance
- Use the unified components as the single source of truth
- Avoid creating "Enhanced" or "Advanced" variants
- Follow the established folder structure
- Use the main index.ts for clean imports
