### Deep Enhancements (Code & Architecture)

1.  **Refactor "God" Services:**
    * **Observation:** Some services in the `Infrastructure` layer have grown quite large and have multiple responsibilities (e.g., `TuningService`, `QueryService`, `SecurityManagementService`).
    * **Suggestion:**
        * Break down these large services into smaller, more focused services. For example, `TuningService` could be split into `BusinessTableManagementService`, `QueryPatternManagementService`, and `GlossaryManagementService`. `QueryService` could delegate caching logic to a dedicated `QueryCacheService`.
        * This will improve maintainability, testability, and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.
    * **Files to review:** `___forrev/BIReportingCopilot.Infrastructure/Services/TuningService.cs`, `___forrev/BIReportingCopilot.Infrastructure/Services/QueryService.cs`, `___forrev/BIReportingCopilot.Infrastructure/Security/SecurityManagementService.cs`

2.  **Improve Asynchronous Operations in Hubs:**
    * **Observation:** In `QueryStatusHub` and `QueryHub`, some methods like `OnConnectedAsync` and `OnDisconnectedAsync` are not fully awaited in all cases, and some logging could be improved.
    * **Suggestion:** Ensure all async operations are properly awaited. Use `try-catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions during SignalR operations. Centralize user ID retrieval logic to avoid code duplication.
    * **Files to review:** `___forrev/BIReportingCopilot.API/Hubs/QueryHub.cs`, `___forrev/BIReportingCopilot.API/Hubs/QueryStatusHub.cs`

3.  **Enhance Configuration Management:**
    * **Observation:** The application uses a mix of `IOptions`, direct `IConfiguration` injection, and a `UnifiedConfigurationService`. While functional, this could be streamlined. The `SecurityConfiguration` has some redundant properties (e.g., `EnableRateLimit` and `EnableRateLimiting`).
    * **Suggestion:**
        * Consolidate all configuration access through the `UnifiedConfigurationService`. This provides a single, consistent way to access configuration and can handle caching and validation centrally.
        * Clean up the `SecurityConfiguration` model to remove redundant properties.
    * **Files to review:** `___forrev/BIReportingCopilot.Infrastructure/Configuration/UnifiedConfigurationService.cs`, `___forrev/BIReportingCopilot.Core/Configuration/UnifiedConfigurationModels.cs`

4.  **Optimize Database Context (`BICopilotContext`):**
    * **Observation:** The `BICopilotContext` is very large and contains `DbSet` properties for both Core models and Infrastructure entities. This can lead to a bloated context and potential performance issues.
    * **Suggestion:**
        * Consider splitting the `DbContext` into smaller, bounded contexts. For example, a `SecurityDbContext` for users and roles, an `AuditDbContext` for logging, and a `TuningDbContext` for AI tuning tables.
        * Remove `DbSet` properties for Core models if they are not directly mapped to tables. Use DTOs for projections instead.
    * **Files to review:** `___forrev/BIReportingCopilot.Infrastructure/Data/BICopilotContext.cs`

5.  âœ… **CQRS Refinement - FULLY COMPLETED:**
    * âœ… **Business Logic Extraction:** Moved 400+ lines from QueryService to focused handlers
    * âœ… **Command Handlers:** ProcessQueryCommand, GenerateSqlCommand, ExecuteSqlCommand, CacheQueryCommand, etc.
    * âœ… **Query Handlers:** GetQueryHistoryQuery, GetCachedQueryQuery, GetQuerySuggestionsQuery, etc.
    * âœ… **Validation Pipeline:** FluentValidation for all commands and queries with comprehensive rules
    * âœ… **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** ValidationBehavior, PerformanceBehavior, AuditBehavior
    * âœ… **Clean Separation:** Commands vs Queries with focused responsibilities
    * âœ… **Enhanced Testability:** Individual handlers can be unit tested in isolation
    * âœ… **SQL Injection Protection:** Built into ExecuteSqlCommandValidator
    * âœ… **Performance Monitoring:** Automatic tracking for all operations
