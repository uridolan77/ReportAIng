Phase 5 Objectives: Cost Control and Optimization
Implement comprehensive cost control and optimization features to make the BI Reporting Copilot enterprise-ready with intelligent resource management.

Core Phase 5 Components to Implement:
1. Dynamic Model Selection & Cost Management
AI Provider Cost Tracking: Track costs per provider (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, future providers)
Dynamic Model Selection: Automatically select optimal model based on query complexity and cost constraints
Cost Budgeting: Set and enforce cost budgets per user, department, or time period
Cost Prediction: Predict query costs before execution
Provider Failover: Intelligent failover between providers based on cost and availability
2. Comprehensive Caching Strategy
Multi-Layer Caching: Semantic cache, query result cache, schema cache, AI response cache
Intelligent Cache Invalidation: Smart invalidation based on data changes and time-based policies
Cache Performance Analytics: Track cache hit rates, performance improvements, cost savings
Distributed Caching: Redis-based distributed caching for scalability
Cache Warming: Proactive cache population for frequently accessed data
3. Performance Optimization Engine
Query Performance Analysis: Detailed performance metrics and optimization suggestions
Resource Usage Monitoring: Track CPU, memory, database connections, API calls
Performance Benchmarking: Establish baselines and track improvements
Automatic Performance Tuning: Self-optimizing system parameters
Performance Alerting: Proactive alerts for performance degradation
4. Resource Management & Throttling
Rate Limiting: Sophisticated rate limiting per user, API endpoint, and resource type
Resource Quotas: Configurable quotas for AI calls, database queries, storage
Priority-Based Processing: Queue management with priority levels
Load Balancing: Intelligent load distribution across resources
Circuit Breakers: Fault tolerance and graceful degradation
5. Cost Analytics & Reporting
Real-Time Cost Dashboard: Live cost monitoring and visualization
Cost Attribution: Detailed cost breakdown by user, department, query type
Cost Optimization Recommendations: AI-powered cost reduction suggestions
Budget Alerts: Proactive notifications when approaching budget limits
ROI Analysis: Return on investment tracking for AI features

Maintain Backward Compatibility: Ensure all existing functionality continues to work
Performance First: Every new feature should improve or maintain system performance
Cost Awareness: Every AI call, database query, and resource usage should be tracked
Real-Time Monitoring: Provide live visibility into costs and performance
Configuration Driven: Make all policies and thresholds configurable
Comprehensive Testing: Include unit tests for critical cost and performance logic
