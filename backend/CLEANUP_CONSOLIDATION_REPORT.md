## Migration Guide

### For Developers:

1. **AI Services:**
   ```csharp
   // Old way
   IOpenAIService openAI;
   IStreamingOpenAIService streamingAI;

   // New way
   IAIService aiService; // Provides both capabilities
   ```

2. **User Operations:**
   ```csharp
   // Old way
   IUserRepository userRepo;
   IUserEntityRepository entityRepo;

   // New way
   IUserRepository userRepo; // Handles both domain and entity operations
   ```

3. **Cache Operations:**
   ```csharp
   // Enhanced capabilities
   ICacheService cache;
   await cache.GetMultipleAsync<T>(keys);
   await cache.SetMultipleAsync<T>(keyValuePairs);
   var stats = await cache.GetStatisticsAsync();
   ```

### Breaking Changes:
- None in this phase (backward compatibility maintained)
- Deprecation warnings will be added in next phase
- Full migration required in final phase

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements:
- **Reduced Memory Usage:** Elimination of duplicate service instances
- **Better Caching:** Unified cache strategy across all services
- **Faster Startup:** Fewer service registrations and dependencies
- **Improved Maintainability:** Cleaner code structure and reduced complexity

### Monitoring:
- Service startup time
- Memory usage patterns
- Cache hit ratios
- Query processing performance

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- New unified services require comprehensive test coverage
- Existing tests to be updated to use new interfaces
- Mock implementations for testing scenarios

### Integration Tests:
- End-to-end testing with unified services
- Performance benchmarking
- Backward compatibility verification

### Migration Testing:
