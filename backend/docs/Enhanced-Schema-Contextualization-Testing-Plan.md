# Enhanced Schema Contextualization System - Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed testing plan for validating the Enhanced Schema Contextualization System integration in the Query Execution Controller. The plan includes 5 comprehensive test scenarios covering different business domains, query types, and complexity levels to ensure the system delivers production-quality results.

**Testing Objective**: Validate that the Query Execution Controller now delivers the same high-quality results as the AI Pipeline Test Controller (75% confidence, 4-5 relevant tables, production-quality SQL).

**Expected Improvements**:
- Business Context Confidence: 10% → 70-90%
- Schema Tables Retrieved: 0 tables → 3-5 tables
- SQL Generation: AI refusal → Production-quality SQL
- End-to-End Functionality: Broken → Fully working

## 6. Troubleshooting Guide

### 6.1 Common Issues and Solutions

#### Low Confidence Scores (<50%)
- **Cause**: Business context analysis struggling with query interpretation
- **Solution**: Check business metadata completeness, rephrase query
- **Investigation**: Review `BusinessTableInfo` and `BusinessColumnInfo` data

#### No Schema Tables Retrieved
- **Cause**: Schema retrieval service not finding relevant tables
- **Solution**: Verify business metadata mappings, check table relationships
- **Investigation**: Test schema retrieval service independently

#### SQL Generation Failures
- **Cause**: Enhanced prompt building or AI service issues
- **Solution**: Check prompt template, verify AI service connectivity
- **Investigation**: Review generated prompts and AI service logs

#### Performance Issues (>30 seconds)
- **Cause**: Database queries, AI service latency, or complex schema retrieval
- **Solution**: Optimize database queries, check AI service performance
- **Investigation**: Profile each pipeline step execution time

### 6.2 Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check business metadata
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  "https://localhost:55244/api/business/tables?search=Daily_actions"

# Test schema retrieval independently
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -X POST "https://localhost:55244/api/business-schema/analyze" \
  -d '{"question":"deposits by country"}'

# Monitor AI service health
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  "https://localhost:55244/api/ai/health"
```
