BUSINESS DOMAIN CONTEXT:
- This is a gaming/casino database tracking player activities, bonuses, and financial transactions
- ''Daily actions'' refer to player activities that occurred on a specific date
- ''Totals'' usually mean aggregated amounts, counts, or sums of financial values
- ''Today'' means the current date (use CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE) for today''s date)
- ''Bonus balances'' are financial amounts related to player bonuses
- Players perform actions that may trigger bonus calculations

DATABASE SCHEMA:
{schema}

USER QUESTION: {question}
{context}

BUSINESS LOGIC RULES:
{business_rules}

PLAYER DATA STRUCTURE:
- Player details are in tbl_Daily_actions_players with foreign key relationships
- ALWAYS join with reference tables for complete player information:
  * Countries: INNER JOIN common.tbl_Countries co WITH (NOLOCK) ON co.CountryID = dap.CountryID
  * Currencies: INNER JOIN common.tbl_Currencies cr WITH (NOLOCK) ON cr.CurrencyCode = dap.Currency  
  * White Labels: INNER JOIN common.tbl_White_labels wl WITH (NOLOCK) ON wl.LabelID = dap.CasinoID
- Use descriptive names: co.CountryName, cr.CurrencyName, wl.LabelName instead of IDs
- Player queries should include geographic and brand context when relevant
- For player analysis, consider demographics: country, currency, casino brand (white label)

EXAMPLE QUERIES:
{examples}

TECHNICAL RULES:
1. Only use SELECT statements - never INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
2. Use proper table and column names exactly as shown in schema
3. CRITICAL: For deposits, ALWAYS use ''Deposits'' column, NEVER ''Amount''
4. CRITICAL: For game analytics, use tbl_Daily_actions_games and ALWAYS join with Games table
5. CRITICAL: Games table join: INNER JOIN dbo.Games g WITH (NOLOCK) ON g.GameID = dag.GameID - 1000000
6. CRITICAL: For game queries, NEVER show GameID - ALWAYS show g.GameName, g.Provider, g.GameType
7. CRITICAL: For player queries, ALWAYS join with reference tables (Countries, Currencies, White_labels)
8. CRITICAL: Show descriptive names (CountryName, CurrencyName, LabelName) not IDs in results
9. Include appropriate WHERE clauses for filtering (Date or GameDate)
10. Use JOINs when querying multiple tables based on foreign key relationships
11. Add meaningful column aliases (e.g., SUM(RealBetAmount) AS TotalBets)
12. Add ORDER BY for logical sorting (usually by date DESC or amount DESC)
13. Use SELECT TOP 100 at the beginning to limit results (NEVER put TOP at the end)
14. Return only the SQL query without explanations or markdown formatting
15. Ensure all referenced columns exist in the schema
16. Always add WITH (NOLOCK) hint to all table references for better read performance
17. Format table hints as: FROM TableName alias WITH (NOLOCK) - never use AS keyword with table hints
18. For game queries: Choose appropriate grouping level based on user request:
    - "per game type" or "by game type" → GROUP BY g.GameType only
    - "per provider" or "by provider" → GROUP BY g.Provider only  
    - "per game" or "by game name" → GROUP BY g.GameName, g.Provider, g.GameType
    - Always include relevant dimension columns in SELECT that match GROUP BY
19. For player queries: Choose appropriate grouping level based on user request:
    - "per country" or "by country" → GROUP BY co.CountryName only
    - "per currency" or "by currency" → GROUP BY cr.CurrencyName only
    - "per casino" or "by casino/brand" → GROUP BY wl.LabelName only
    - "per player" or "by player" → GROUP BY dap.PlayerID only
    - Always include relevant dimension columns in SELECT that match GROUP BY
20. CRITICAL AGGREGATION RULES:
    - When user asks for "Total X" or "Overall X" → NO GROUP BY clause (single aggregate result)
    - When user asks for "X per Y" or "X by Y" → GROUP BY Y column only
    - When user asks for "X for [time period]" → NO GROUP BY clause (single aggregate result)
    - NEVER add GROUP BY unless user explicitly requests breakdown/grouping
    - Match GROUP BY exactly to user intent - don''t over-group when user wants summary data

CORRECT SQL STRUCTURE:
SELECT TOP 100 column1, column2, column3
FROM table1 t1 WITH (NOLOCK)
JOIN table2 t2 WITH (NOLOCK) ON t1.id = t2.id
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column1 DESC',
    [Version] = '2.2',
    [Description] = 'Enhanced SQL generation template with player data structure and reference table joins',
    [CreatedDate] = GETUTCDATE()
WHERE [Name] = 'sql_generation';

-- Verify the update
SELECT [Name], [Version], [Description], [IsActive], [CreatedDate]
FROM [dbo].[PromptTemplates] 
WHERE [Name] = 'sql_generation';

PRINT 'Prompt template updated successfully. The AI will now understand player data structure with proper joins for Countries, Currencies, and White Labels.';
